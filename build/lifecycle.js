/**
 * Process lifecycle for the stdio server: notice the client is gone, and exit.
 *
 * A stdio MCP server has no life of its own. It is spawned by a client, it speaks to that
 * client over stdin/stdout, and once that client is gone it can neither be useful nor be
 * noticed — its only channel to the world is a socket whose peer is dead. Nothing in this
 * codebase said so, so the server never exited. Issue #149: after a Claude Code session
 * died uncleanly, orphaned servers reparented to init and pegged a CPU core *forever* —
 * two of them had burned 31 minutes of CPU in 31 minutes of wall time.
 *
 * Two defects compounded. The server never noticed the client died (no signal was
 * watched), and the `uncaughtException` guard in index.ts became a perpetual motion
 * machine: it logged to stderr, and once the peer was dead that write raised the next
 * uncaught exception, which re-entered the handler, which wrote to the same dead stderr…
 * The handler swallowed every exception (so the process never died) while generating the
 * next one. ~70% of samples were in stack formatting — the process spent its life
 * formatting traces for errors caused by reporting the previous error.
 *
 * The fix is three layers. Each independently prevents the spin, and each covers a gap the
 * others have — this is measured, not assumed (see ADR-104 for the matrix):
 *
 *   1. Crash guards that cannot re-enter  (kills the busy-loop structurally)
 *   2. An orphan watchdog                 (reclaims the process; the only exit decision)
 *   3. stdin end/close                    (fastest signal, when the OS delivers it)
 *
 * Neither of the two obvious single-layer fixes is sufficient. The watchdog alone still
 * spins at 101% when the socket peer dies but the parent lives — the parent is alive, so
 * it never fires. The guard alone stops the spin but leaks an idle orphan forever.
 *
 * Split out of index.ts so it can be UNIT TESTED, for the same reason node-floor.ts was
 * (ADR-102): logic that lives inline in the entrypoint is logic nothing can test, and a
 * revert once slipped through `make check`, all tests, and every CI job because of exactly
 * that. `isOrphaned` is therefore a pure function, tested directly.
 *
 * Imports only `node:fs` (a builtin), so index.ts may import it statically without
 * tripping the ESM/CJS hazard the Node floor guards. See the index.ts header.

/**
 * Whether the process has been orphaned, given a startup ppid and what we see now.
 *
 * Pure so it can be tested without spawning process trees. Two signals, because neither
 * covers every platform:
 *
 * `currentPpid !== originalPpid` — on Unix a dead parent means immediate reparenting to
 * init/systemd, so a *changed* ppid is definitive. This is the reliable one, and it is
 * immune to PID reuse.
 *
 * `!parentAlive` — a `kill(pid, 0)` probe, for platforms that don't reparent (Windows).
 * Note this is checked against the ORIGINAL ppid, captured at startup.
 *
 * Why the original ppid matters: `process.ppid` is a LIVE GETTER, not a value fixed at
 * startup. The fix suggested in #149 polls `process.kill(process.ppid, 0)`, which re-reads
 * ppid every tick — after reparenting that reads as init/systemd, which is always alive,
 * so the check never fires and the server spins on. Measured: after the parent died, ppid
 * moved 2884591 -> 2951 (systemd), and kill(2951, 0) reports alive. Reading ppid once, at
 * startup, is the whole trick.

     * we ask the watchdog to test the real question, right now. When we are genuinely
     * orphaned that reclaims the process in ~0ms instead of waiting up to 5s for the next
     * poll — which is the difference that matters on macOS, where stdin EOF never arrives
     * and this is the earliest signal we get.
