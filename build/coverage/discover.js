/**
 * Discover Google's API surface — by asking Google.
 *
 * The descriptor records where each service's Discovery document lives (which
 * cannot be templated — Calendar is served from `calendar-json.googleapis.com`),
 * so we look it up and read it.
 *
 * NEVER DERIVE THE SURFACE FROM HUMAN-READABLE PROSE. A regex over `--help` text
 * once captured `calendars.The` — a word from a wrapped description line — and
 * recorded it in coverage-baseline.json as an uncovered "gap": a method that does
 * not exist, offered to contributors as work they could pick up. Nothing caught
 * it, because the only source of truth was typography.
 *
 * The denominator must be GOOGLE'S surface. Counting invented operations, or
 * services we deliberately do not support, makes the headline percentage fiction.
 *
 * WHY FETCH RATHER THAN READ THE DESCRIPTOR: the committed descriptor is
 * deliberately structure-only — no descriptions — because it ships at RUNTIME and
 * descriptions would add +162 KB to every install for text no server ever reads.
 * Coverage is a DEV command. It can afford the network, and it needs the prose to
 * make "the frontier" actionable.
 *
 * See ADR-103, verification item 11.
