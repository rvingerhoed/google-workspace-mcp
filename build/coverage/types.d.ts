     * This exists because the baseline used to INFER coverage from `paramGaps` — an
     * operation was recorded as covered only if it had a parameter gap. An operation
     * covered *perfectly*, with every parameter mapped, therefore had no gap entry, fell
     * through, and was written to the baseline as `status: "gap"`. The baseline called an
     * operation uncovered BECAUSE it was flawlessly covered, and 25 of them were committed
     * as uncovered work for contributors to pick up.
     *
     * `coveredOps` (the count) was right the whole time; only the persisted list was wrong,
     * so the printed report and the committed artifact disagreed and nothing compared them.
     * Coverage is now carried explicitly, from the manifest, and asserted against the count.
