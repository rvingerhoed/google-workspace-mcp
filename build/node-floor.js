 * fix once slipped through `make check`, all 681 tests and every CI job, because nothing
 * anywhere exercised the comparison. `check-node-floor.mjs` checks that MIN_NODE has the
 * right VALUE and that the entrypoint imports the server dynamically; neither says
 * anything about whether the arithmetic is correct.
 *
 * This module imports only `node:fs` (a builtin). It CANNOT trigger the ESM/CJS failure
 * the guard exists to prevent, so index.ts may import it statically. Only the server
 * graph must stay behind the dynamic import.
