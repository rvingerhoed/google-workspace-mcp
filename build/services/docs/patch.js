         * error, indistinguishable from a document that really is short. The same instinct

         * empty, absent from the response, along with `headers`, `lists`, `inlineObjects` and
         * `namedStyles`. Measured live against three real documents: without the flag,
         * `body` held 10,388 characters and `tabs` was absent; with it, `body` was absent and
         * the three tabs held 10,388 + 3,832 + 698. So reading `tabs` first is load-bearing,
         * not a preference — read `body` first and a tabbed document comes back EMPTY. The
         * `body` fallback covers only the flagless shape, which nothing here now requests.
         *
         * Google's reference says `body` is "left as empty" rather than dropped; measurement
         * says dropped. The code assumes neither: it treats an empty `tabs[0]` and an absent
         * `body` the same way round, so both shapes read correctly.
         *
         * Single-tab documents report one tab titled "Tab 1" — a default, not something a
         * user typed, so one tab renders with no tab scaffolding at all.
